      You cannot teach what you do not know.
      It is impossible to narrow down a topic without sufficient knowledge of the topic.
      You acquire the knowledge through reading.
      Look through peer-reviewed sources and books.
      It might be useful to check out more books than needed, then narrow down.
      Cast a wide net, then narrow down.
      The medium is more or less irrelevant.
      Books that are on the internet are still books and should be treated as such.

      Sometimes your field is underdeveloped or has a lack of good sources and research to use.
      This is more rare than often, but still happens.
      Your topic might have questions or concerns that are not easily addressed and your scholarship can contribute to a larger understanding.
      You may need to debate, dispute and or refute other scholars conclusions.
      Your debate should contribute to the topic.
      Avoid coming across snarky, superior, or vindictive. Avoid personal attacks via scholarship.
      You may engage in revisionist scholarship.
      This generally has a negative tone, but this should not discourage someone from refuting anothers ideas.

      Too many undergraduate papers begin their research paper with, "since the beginning of time" or
      "in the history of theater." There are people who have time, and are qualified, to write about the complete works of a topic.
      But as an undergraduate student you are not one of those people. You dont have the time to compile and engage in a grandious discussion on the
      works of an entire complete collection of topics from the beginning of time.

      This is the death-star, lets say it represents Chilean history.
      You are Luke Skywalker and are tasked to destroy the Death-Star which symbolically represents writing on the Chilean history.
      However your own tool is an X-Wing fighter, which is a metaphor for your computer and other library resources.
      How are you supposed to take out something so large with something so small?

      The answer is...
      You can't! You can however tackle small things which lead to much larger things.
      In Luke Skywalkers case he focuses on a thermal exhaust port two meters wide in the Death-Stars trench.
      A well placed proton torpedo allowed Luke Skywalker to blow up the Death-Star.
      Your term paper is the well placed proton torpedo which is one small part of one aspect of one period of Chilean history.

      One thing to keep in mind while writing your paper, is that research is an iterative process.
      Meaning that it preceeds an ever developing and expanding stages. It is not linear.
      You will realize that you need more information and sources at some point.
      You will write more, then find more sources and read them, then write more, and so on and so on.
      Until you come to the point where you finish your revision and someone else revises it and makes suggestions,
      where you will go back and revise it again. This means your paper will be in a constant state of revision until your paper is done.
      Thats okay, because that is what drafts are all about.

      First it is an editorial process, meaning that the texts that go through this process
      are intended for publication. Publishers are investing time and money. Because of that, they try to produce
      the highest quality product possible. Second, the definition of Peer is a person with experience and credentials in
      a particular field that can give an informed opinion about the quality and relevance of the research. This is important
      because the process of peer review is not about punctuation, formatting, or vocabulary. Rather its about making sure that the methodology,
      arguments, sources, and conclusions are factual, appropriate and relevant. Peer-reviewed research should help advance the field in which someone is intending to publish.

      This is a fancy term for the bibliography, notes (either footnotes or endnotes), and the index or indexes.
      A solid academic work will have ALL 3 of these. It will, more often than not, be lengthy. Certain works such
      as articles or older works from spanish and portugese cultures may omit indexes or notes and their citation style may not reflect
      current scholarship standards, but yet the text can still be usable. However, if a text does not have
      a healthy bibliography, the work is suspect. A healthy bibliography and other citations, are key in a work
      because it allows others to verify the sources, and follow up on the content and arguments made.
